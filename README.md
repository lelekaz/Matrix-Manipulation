# Matrix-Manipulation
This project acts as a mini matrix calculator. You can transpose a matrix, add two matrices, and multiply two matrices.

This is a simple code that had been a previous computer science assignment. I improved the code to be more organized and efficient. It's a finished product, but there's always room for improvement.
